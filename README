Date data

Arithmetic with the proleptic gregorian calendar (Month, Day, Weekday).
Arithmetic on local, abstract time-of-day values (LocalTime).

The examples below assume you have exported all relevant classes and
commands from the library as global variables.

Examples
d1 = new Day(2014,5,1)    ==> 5/1/2014
d2 = d1.add(37)           ==> 6/7/2014
d1.lt(d2)                 ==> true
d2.diff(d1)               ==> 37
d1.dayOfWeek              ==> Wednesday
d1.mjd                    ==> 56778
d2.encode()               ==> "2014-06-07"
Day.decode("2014-06-07")  ==> 6/7/2014
d1.month                  ==> 5
m1 = d1.toMonth()         ==> May 2014
m2 = m1.add(3)            ==> August 2014
m2.diff(m1)               ==> 3
d3 = m2.onDay(15)         ==> 8/15/2014
d3.atMidnight()           ==> 8/15/2014 00:00:00
t1 = d3.atTime(15,0,0)    ==> 8/15/2014 15:00:00
t2 = t1.addHours(4)       ==> 8/15/2014 19:00:00
t2.diff(t1)               ==> 14400
t2.unixTime()             ==> 1398970800
t2.day                    ==> 8/15/2014
t2.mjd                    ==> 56884.791666666664
t2.encode()               ==> "2014-08-15 19:00:00"

Notes

The LocalTime data type is an abstract notion of time independent from any
real points in time as measured by a clock. You can consider a LocalTime
value as a point in UTC time if you take care not to mix it with one that
doesn't. Only if you have a UTC time can you compute the unix timestamp
correctly.

The seconds field of a LocalTime is not only fractional, but can be greater
than 60 to represent time during a leap second. LocalTimes with seconds value
60 or more are considered to be the same as midnight of the next day for the
purposes of difference and translations (addSeconds, addDays, etc). Note also
that differences and translations never take into account leap seconds.

I am currently missing, like the js library itself, something like strftime
and strptime for more flexible interaction with string representations. 

There are two kinds of MJD in use here. The mjd property of Day should be
considered the modified julian day number, which is simply the count of days
since 1858-11-17 which is day 0. The mjd property of LocalTime is the more
familiar modified julian date. This is the nominal time, measured in days,
since midnight of 1858-11-17 UTC. Because of this precise meaning, using the
mjd of a LocalTime that doesn't represent UTC is illegal. See the following
plan to fix this.

The operation "unixTime" for a LocalTime assumes that the argument
represents UTC. There is currently no way for it to stop you from
accidentally using it on a civil time that has some offset from UTC. A good
way out of this is to introduce a "ZonedTime" which carries a time zone
series tag so it can know how to get to UTC. This tag is not an offset, but
an index into the "olsen files" which, when combined with the time, give an
offset. Then, only ZonedTime can do the unixTime operation. LocalTime,
simple and zoneless, cannot.  This goes for modified julian date too.

* add formatting
* add parsing
* add zoned time to represent specific timestamps, including utc time
